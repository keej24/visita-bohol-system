# Mobile App Restoration - October 9, 2025

## Issue: App Regressed to Non-Functional State

### Root Cause Identified:
**Missing Drift Code Generation** - After adding the drift dependency, the generated database files were not created/regenerated.

---

## What Was Done to Fix:

### Step 1: Clean Build Cache
```bash
flutter clean
```
**Result:** Removed all cached build artifacts

### Step 2: Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```
**Result:** All packages reinstalled successfully

### Step 3: Add Build Tools
```bash
flutter pub add --dev build_runner drift_dev
```
**Result:** Added code generation tools to dev_dependencies

### Step 4: Generate Drift Database Code
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
**Result:** 
- Generated 201 output files
- Regenerated `offline_database.g.dart` and related files
- Build completed in 54 seconds

### Step 5: Verify Functionality
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```
**Result:** ✅ App successfully launching on Chrome

---

## Current Status: ✅ FUNCTIONAL

- **Error Count:** 141 issues (same as before regression)
- **Build Status:** ✅ Compiles successfully
- **Runtime Status:** ✅ App launches and runs
- **Database:** ✅ Drift ORM properly configured

---

## Key Lesson Learned:

**When using Drift (or any code generation package):**
1. Always add `build_runner` and `drift_dev` to dev_dependencies
2. Run `dart run build_runner build` after adding drift
3. Re-run code generation after `flutter clean`

---

## Updated pubspec.yaml Structure:

```yaml
dependencies:
  drift: ^2.28.2
  # ... other dependencies

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.9.0
  drift_dev: ^2.28.3
  # ... other dev dependencies
```

---

## What to Do If This Happens Again:

If the app breaks after `flutter clean` or similar operations:

```bash
cd mobile-app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
flutter run -d chrome
```

This 4-step process will restore functionality every time.

---

## Files Generated by Drift:

The following files are auto-generated (don't edit manually):
- `lib/database/offline_database.g.dart`
- Various `.drift.dart` files in database folder
- Over 200 generated helper files in `.dart_tool/`

---

## Prevention Tips:

1. **Never commit generated files** - Add to `.gitignore`:
   ```
   *.g.dart
   *.drift.dart
   ```

2. **Document the build process** in README.md

3. **Create a setup script** for new developers:
   ```bash
   # setup.sh
   flutter pub get
   dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```
