```

### 2. Firebase Configuration

Create Firebase projects for different environments:

- `visita-dev` - Development environment
- `visita-staging` - Staging environment  
- `visita-prod` - Production environment

#### Admin Dashboard Environment Files

Create environment files in `admin-dashboard/`:

**`.env.development`**
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_dev_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=visita-dev.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=visita-dev
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=visita-dev.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abcdef123456
VITE_APP_ENV=development
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=true
```

**`.env.production`**
```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_prod_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=visita-prod.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=visita-prod
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=visita-prod.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=987654321
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:987654321:web:fedcba654321
VITE_APP_ENV=production
VITE_DEBUG_MODE=false
```

#### Mobile App Configuration

Update `mobile-app/lib/firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase configuration for each platform.

### 3. Firebase Security Rules

Deploy Firestore and Storage security rules:

```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in project
cd admin-dashboard
firebase init

# Deploy security rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only storage
```

## Admin Dashboard Deployment

### Development Deployment

```bash
cd admin-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Development server will be available at http://localhost:8080
```

### Production Deployment

#### Option 1: Firebase Hosting (Recommended)

```bash
cd admin-dashboard

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Firebase Hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting

# Your app will be available at https://your-project.web.app
```

#### Option 2: Manual Static Hosting

```bash
cd admin-dashboard

# Build for production
npm run build

# Upload dist/ folder contents to your web server
# Configure your web server to serve index.html for all routes (SPA)
```

#### Production Environment Variables

Set production environment variables:

```bash
# Using Firebase CLI
firebase functions:config:set app.env="production"

# Or set in hosting provider's environment variables
```

### Build Optimization

The production build includes several optimizations:

- **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunking for better loading performance
- **Tree Shaking**: Dead code elimination
- **Minification**: JavaScript and CSS compression
- **Source Maps**: Disabled in production for security
- **Console Removal**: Development logs removed

Monitor bundle sizes:

```bash
npm run build

# Check chunk sizes in build output
# Main bundle should be < 500KB after gzipping
```

## Mobile App Deployment

### Android Deployment

#### 1. Prepare for Release

```bash
cd mobile-app

# Update version in pubspec.yaml
# version: 1.0.0+1

```

#### 2. Create Signing Key

```bash
# Generate release keystore
keytool -genkey -v -keystore android/app/release-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias release

# Create android/key.properties
storePassword=your_store_password
keyPassword=your_key_password
keyAlias=release
storeFile=release-keystore.jks
```

#### 3. Build Release APK

```bash
# Build APK
flutter build apk --release

# Build App Bundle (recommended for Play Store)
flutter build appbundle --release
```

npm install firebase-admin

# Set up service account credentials
export FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./firebase-service-account.json

# Run data seeding (be careful in production!)
node scripts/seed-data.js
```

### 2. Database Indexes

Create composite indexes in Firebase Console:

**Churches Collection:**
```
- diocese (Ascending), status (Ascending)
- municipality (Ascending), status (Ascending)  
- heritageClassification (Ascending), status (Ascending)
- createdAt (Descending), status (Ascending)
```

**Announcements Collection:**
```
- diocese (Ascending), status (Ascending), publishedAt (Descending)
- scope (Ascending), status (Ascending), publishedAt (Descending)
- priority (Ascending), status (Ascending), publishedAt (Descending)
```

**Feedback Collection:**
```
- churchId (Ascending), status (Ascending), createdAt (Descending)
- diocese (Ascending), status (Ascending), rating (Descending)
```

### 3. Security Rules Validation

Test security rules:

```bash
# Install Firestore emulator
firebase setup:emulators:firestore

# Run emulator with rules
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# Run security rules tests
npm test -- --testMatch="**/*security*.test.js"
```

## Monitoring and Analytics

### 1. Firebase Analytics

Enable Firebase Analytics in both admin dashboard and mobile app:

```javascript
// Admin Dashboard - Add to main.tsx
import { getAnalytics } from "firebase/analytics";

const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
```

```dart
// Mobile App - Add to main.dart
import 'package:firebase_analytics/firebase_analytics.dart';

FirebaseAnalytics analytics = FirebaseAnalytics.instance;
```

### 2. Error Monitoring

Set up error monitoring service:

**Option 1: Firebase Crashlytics**
```bash
# Install Firebase Crashlytics
flutter pub add firebase_crashlytics

# Initialize in main.dart
```

**Option 2: Sentry**
```bash
# Install Sentry
npm install @sentry/react
flutter pub add sentry_flutter
```

### 3. Performance Monitoring

Enable Firebase Performance Monitoring:

```bash
# Add to both admin dashboard and mobile app
# Follow Firebase Performance setup guide
```

## Backup and Recovery

### 1. Database Backup

Set up automated Firestore backups:

```bash
# Enable Firestore backup via Firebase Console
# Configure backup schedule and retention
```

### 2. Storage Backup

Implement Cloud Storage backup:

```javascript
// Backup script for Firebase Storage
const backup = require('./scripts/backup-storage.js');

// Run backup
backup.backupAllFiles();
```

### 3. Code Repository Backup

Ensure code is backed up to multiple locations:

- Primary: GitHub/GitLab
- Secondary: Cloud storage backup
- Local: Development machines

## SSL and Security

### 1. HTTPS Configuration

Firebase Hosting provides HTTPS by default. For custom domains:

```bash
# Add custom domain in Firebase Console
# Configure DNS settings
# SSL certificates are automatically provisioned
```

### 2. Security Headers

Configure security headers in `firebase.json`:

```json
{
  "hosting": {
    "headers": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "headers": [
          {
            "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
            "value": "nosniff"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-Frame-Options", 
            "value": "DENY"
          },
          {
            "key": "X-XSS-Protection",
            "value": "1; mode=block"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### 3. Content Security Policy

Add CSP headers for enhanced security:

```json
{
  "key": "Content-Security-Policy",
  "value": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://apis.google.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
}
```
