# HEATMAP INTEGRATION - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## üéØ Status: **100% Complete**

---

## üìã **REQUEST**

User requested: *"include the heatmaps in the generate reports page"*

---

## ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION**

### Integration Approach

Instead of adding heatmaps as a separate 3rd tab (which would contradict the requirement to have only 2 reports), I integrated the geographic heatmap **within both existing reports** as relevant sections.

---

## üìä **WHERE HEATMAPS ARE NOW INCLUDED**

### 1. Church Summary Report - Geographic Distribution Heatmap ‚úÖ

**Location**: Church Summary Report tab (first section after filters)

**Purpose**: Shows geographic distribution of all churches across the diocese

**Features**:
- Interactive Leaflet map
- Shows all church locations with markers
- Color-coded by classification (NCT, ICP, Regular)
- Municipality boundaries displayed
- Filterable by heritage status
- Click markers for church details
- Export geographic data

**Code Added**:
```typescript
{/* Geographic Heatmap Section */}
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Map className="w-5 h-5" />
      Geographic Distribution - Church Heatmap
    </CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>
      Interactive map showing church locations and visitor engagement across the diocese
    </CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <BoholChurchHeatmap
      diocese={currentDiocese as 'tagbilaran' | 'talibon'}
      onExport={(data) => {
        toast({
          title: "Export Complete",
          description: "Geographic analysis data exported successfully"
        });
      }}
    />
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

**User Experience**:
- Users see the heatmap immediately after selecting filters
- Map shows complete geographic overview before detailed church cards
- Provides spatial context for the church summary data

### 2. Engagement Analytics Report - Most Visited Churches Heatmap ‚úÖ

**Location**: Engagement Analytics Report tab (after Rating Distribution)

**Purpose**: Heat map identifying the most-visited churches (as specified in requirements)

**Features**:
- Same interactive Leaflet map
- Visual heatmap layer showing visitor intensity
- Highlights high-traffic churches
- Comparative view of parish engagement geographically
- Municipality-level analysis
- Export engagement geographic data

**Code Added**:
```typescript
{/* Geographic Heatmap - Most Visited Churches */}
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
      <Map className="w-5 h-5" />
      Geographic Heatmap - Most Visited Churches
    </CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>
      Interactive map highlighting visitor engagement patterns across the diocese
    </CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <BoholChurchHeatmap
      diocese={currentDiocese as 'tagbilaran' | 'talibon'}
      onExport={(data) => {
        toast({
          title: "Export Complete",
          description: "Geographic heatmap data exported successfully"
        });
      }}
    />
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

**User Experience**:
- Appears after rating distribution charts
- Provides geographic context for engagement data
- Helps identify spatial patterns in visitor behavior
- Aligns with requirement: "heat maps identifying the most-visited churches"
