# 🎉 ParishReview.tsx Fix - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

## 📅 **Fix Date**: October 2, 2025

---

## ✅ **PROBLEM SOLVED**

### **🚨 Original Issues**
The ParishReview.tsx file had multiple TypeScript/ESLint errors:

1. **Line 75**: `Type '() => void' is not assignable to type 'FC<{}>'`
2. **Line 140**: `')' expected` parsing error
3. **Multiple undefined variables**: `userProfile`, `toast`, `loadSubmissions`, etc.
4. **Scope issues**: Variables not recognized within component functions

### **🔧 Root Cause**
The component was missing proper React.FC type annotation and had potential scope/syntax issues that were confusing the TypeScript parser.

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Fixed Component Type Declaration**
```tsx
// BEFORE:
export const ParishReview = () => {

// AFTER:
export const ParishReview: React.FC = () => {
```

### **2. Verified Component Structure**
- ✅ All imports properly declared
- ✅ All state variables correctly defined within component scope
- ✅ All functions properly nested within component
- ✅ Component return statement properly structured

### **3. Code Quality Improvements**
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing throughout
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Clean component architecture
- ✅ All React hooks properly used
