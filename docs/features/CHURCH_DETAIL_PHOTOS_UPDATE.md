# ✅ Church Detail Screen - Photos Update

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Photos Tab** ✅
- Changed `TabController` length from **6 to 5**
- Removed "Photos" tab from the TabBar
- Removed `_PhotosTab` widget from TabBarView
- Deleted the entire `_PhotosTab` class (170+ lines removed)

### 2. **Made Header Images Scrollable** ✅
- Replaced single static image with **PageView** for horizontal scrolling
- Added **PageController** to manage image swiping
- Added **page indicator dots** below the images showing current position
- Shows which image is currently visible (white dot = active, translucent dots = inactive)

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience** ✨
- Users can now swipe through all church photos in the hero header
- **${images.length}** indicator dots appear when church has multiple photos
- Smooth transitions between images with animation
- No need for separate Photos tab anymore

## Current Tab Structure

The church detail screen now has **5 tabs** instead of 6:

1. 📜 **History** - Church background and heritage information
2. 📍 **Visit** - Location, contact info, mass schedules
3. 📢 **Announcements** - Parish announcements (dedicated tab)
4. 📁 **Documents** - Historical documents
5. ⭐ **Reviews** - User feedback and ratings

## How It Works

### Header Image Scrolling:
```dart
// PageView with all church images
PageView.builder(
  controller: _imagePageController,
  itemCount: church.images.length,
  onPageChanged: (index) => setState(() => _currentImageIndex = index),
  itemBuilder: (context, index) => _buildChurchImage(church.images[index]),
)

// Page indicator dots
Row(
  children: List.generate(
    church.images.length,
    (index) => Dot(active: _currentImageIndex == index),
  ),
)
```

### User Interaction:
- **Swipe left/right** on header to view all church photos
- **White dot** shows current photo
- **Gradient overlay** ensures text remains readable
- **Smooth animations** between images

## Benefits

✅ **Cleaner Navigation** - One less tab to manage
✅ **Better UX** - Photos immediately visible without clicking a tab
✅ **More Intuitive** - Swipe to see more photos (familiar mobile pattern)
✅ **Space Efficient** - Removed 170+ lines of code
✅ **Consistent Design** - Matches modern app patterns
