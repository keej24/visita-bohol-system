# Feedback Display Fix - Complete Summary

## Problem
After submitting a review, it wasn't appearing in the Reviews tab. Error in console:
```
POST https://firestore.googleapis.com/google.firestore.v1.Firestore/Listen/channel 400 (Bad Request)
```

## Root Causes

1. **Query used wrong field**: Service was ordering by `createdAt` (ISO string) instead of `date_submitted` (Firestore Timestamp)
2. **Missing Firestore index**: Composite query required an index that didn't exist
3. **Reviews tab not refreshing**: StatelessWidget couldn't rebuild after submission

## Fixes Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ Updated Feedback Service Queries

**File:** `mobile-app/lib/services/feedback_service.dart`

**Changes:**
- Line 15: Changed `orderBy('createdAt')` ‚Üí `orderBy('date_submitted')`
- Line 50: Changed `orderBy('createdAt')` ‚Üí `orderBy('date_submitted')`

**Why:** Firestore Timestamps sort properly, ISO strings don't. The `date_submitted` field is saved as a Timestamp by the mobile app.

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Feedback Model Compatibility

**File:** `mobile-app/lib/models/feedback.dart`

**Added fields for admin dashboard compatibility:**
```dart
'message': comment,              // Admin expects 'message' or 'comment'
'subject': '${category.label} Review',  // Admin expects 'subject'
'images': photos,                // Admin expects 'images' or 'photos'
'date_submitted': createdAt,     // Firestore Timestamp for queries
```

**Why:** Ensures seamless integration between mobile app and admin dashboard with different naming conventions.

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Created Firestore Composite Index

**File:** `admin-dashboard/firestore.indexes.json`

**Added index:**
```json
{
  "collectionGroup": "feedback",
  "queryScope": "COLLECTION",
  "fields": [
    {
      "fieldPath": "church_id",
      "order": "ASCENDING"
    },
    {
      "fieldPath": "status",
      "order": "ASCENDING"
    },
    {
      "fieldPath": "date_submitted",
      "order": "DESCENDING"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Deployed:** ‚úÖ Successfully deployed to Firebase

**Why:** Firestore requires composite indexes for queries that combine `where` clauses with `orderBy` on different fields.

---

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Reviews Tab Refresh (Still Pending)

**File:** `mobile-app/lib/screens/church_detail_screen.dart`

**Required changes:** See `REVIEW_REFRESH_FIX.md` for detailed instructions

**Status:** Documentation provided, manual changes required

**What it fixes:** Makes the Reviews tab refresh automatically after submitting a review
