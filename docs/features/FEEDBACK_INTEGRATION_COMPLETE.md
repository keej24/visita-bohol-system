# Feedback/Review System - Complete Integration Summary

## Overview
The feedback system is now fully integrated across all three components of the VISITA system:
1. **Mobile App** - Users submit reviews
2. **Parish Dashboard** - Parish secretaries view and moderate reviews for their church
3. **Chancery Dashboard** - Chancery office views all reviews across the diocese

---

## Data Flow

### 1. Mobile App → Firestore
When a user submits a review:

**Collection:** `feedback`

**Fields saved:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "userId": "firebase_auth_uid",
  "userName": "John Doe",
  "pub_user_id": "firebase_auth_uid",        // Parish dashboard compatibility
  "pub_user_name": "John Doe",               // Parish dashboard compatibility
  "churchId": "church_id",
  "church_id": "church_id",                   // Parish dashboard compatibility
  "comment": "This church is beautiful...",
  "message": "This church is beautiful...",   // Admin dashboard compatibility
  "subject": "General Review",                // Admin dashboard compatibility
  "rating": 5,
  "photos": ["url1", "url2"],
  "images": ["url1", "url2"],                 // Admin dashboard compatibility
  "createdAt": "2025-10-07T10:30:00.000Z",
  "date_submitted": Timestamp,                // Firestore timestamp for admin
  "category": "general",
  "status": "published",
  "hasResponse": false,
  "response": null,
  "responseDate": null
}
```

**Code Location:**
- Model: `mobile-app/lib/models/feedback.dart`
- Service: `mobile-app/lib/services/feedback_service.dart`
- Submit Screen: `mobile-app/lib/screens/feedback_submit_screen.dart`

---

### 2. Parish Dashboard ← Firestore
Parish secretaries can view and moderate reviews for their church.

**What they can do:**
- ✅ View all reviews for their church in real-time
- ✅ See ratings, comments, and user names
- ✅ Hide inappropriate reviews (status: published → hidden)
- ✅ Unhide reviews (status: hidden → published)
- ✅ View feedback statistics (total, average rating, etc.)

**Query:**
```typescript
// Real-time subscription
where('church_id', '==', churchId)
orderBy('date_submitted', 'desc')
```

**Code Location:**
- Component: `admin-dashboard/src/components/parish/ParishFeedback.tsx`
- Service: `admin-dashboard/src/services/feedbackService.ts`

**Access Control:**
- Parish secretaries can only see feedback for their assigned church
- Enforced by Firestore security rules

---

### 3. Chancery Dashboard ← Firestore
Chancery office can view ALL reviews across the diocese.

**What they can do:**
- ✅ View all reviews for all churches in their diocese
- ✅ Filter by church, status, rating
- ✅ Search by user name, comment, or subject
- ✅ Moderate reviews (hide/publish)
- ✅ View diocese-wide statistics

**Query:**
```typescript
// 1. Get all churches in diocese
where('diocese', '==', userProfile.diocese)

// 2. Get all feedback for those churches
orderBy('date_submitted', 'desc')
// Filter client-side to only include churches in diocese
```

**Code Location:**
- Page: `admin-dashboard/src/pages/Feedback.tsx`
- Service: `admin-dashboard/src/services/feedbackService.ts`

**Access Control:**
- Chancery office can see all churches in their diocese
- Enforced by diocese field matching

---

## Field Mapping & Compatibility

The mobile app saves data with **dual field names** to ensure compatibility with both the parish and chancery dashboards:

| Mobile App Field | Parish/Chancery Field | Purpose |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------|
| `userId` | `pub_user_id` | User identifier |
| `userName` | `pub_user_name` | Display name |
| `churchId` | `church_id` | Church identifier |
| `comment` | `message` | Review text |
| `createdAt` (ISO string) | `date_submitted` (Timestamp) | Submission time |
| `photos` | `images` | Photo URLs |
| N/A | `subject` | Auto-generated: "{category} Review" |

**Why dual fields?**
- Different naming conventions between mobile (camelCase) and admin (snake_case)
- Ensures backward compatibility
- Admin dashboard can read both formats

---

## Status Workflow

### Status Values
- `published` - Review is visible to everyone (default)
- `hidden` - Review is hidden by moderator
- `pending` - Review awaiting moderation (not currently used)

### Moderation Flow
```
User submits review
  ↓
status: 'published' (auto-published)
  ↓
Appears in mobile app immediately
  ↓
Parish secretary can hide if inappropriate
  ↓
status: 'hidden'
  ↓
No longer visible in mobile app
```

**Moderation Fields:**
- `moderatedAt`: Timestamp when status changed
- `moderatedBy`: User ID of moderator

---

## Mobile App Display

After submission, reviews appear in the church detail screen's **Reviews tab**.

**Requirements for refresh:**
1. ✅ Convert `_ReviewsTab` to `StatefulWidget`
2. ✅ Add `_loadReviews()` method to refresh data
3. ✅ Call `_loadReviews()` after successful submission
4. ✅ Handle web platform for photo display

**Implementation Status:**
- ⚠️ Requires manual changes (see `REVIEW_REFRESH_FIX.md`)

**Display Logic:**
```dart
FutureBuilder(
  future: fbSvc.load(),
  builder: (context, snap) {
    final list = (snap.data ?? [])
        .where((f) => f.churchId == church.id)
        .where((f) => f.status == 'published') // Only show published
        .toList();
    // Display reviews...
  }
)
```

---

## Security Rules

**Firestore Rules (admin-dashboard/firestore.rules):**

```javascript
// Feedback collection rules
match /feedback/{feedbackId} {
  // Anyone can read published feedback
  allow read: if resource.data.status == 'published';

  // Authenticated users can create feedback
  allow create: if request.auth != null;

  // Parish secretaries can update their church's feedback
  allow update: if hasRole('parish_secretary') &&
                   resource.data.church_id == getUserData().parish;

  // Chancery office can moderate all feedback in their diocese
  allow update: if hasRole('chancery_office');
}
```

## Recent Changes

### 2025-10-07: Enhanced Compatibility
**File:** `mobile-app/lib/models/feedback.dart`

**Changes:**
```dart
// Added admin dashboard compatibility fields
'message': comment,              // Admin expects 'message' or 'comment'
'subject': '${category.label} Review',  // Admin expects 'subject'
'images': photos,                // Admin expects 'images' or 'photos'
'date_submitted': createdAt,     // Admin expects Timestamp
```

**Why:**
- Ensures smooth integration with admin dashboard
- Admin dashboard can read feedback without modifications
- Maintains backward compatibility

---

## Summary

✅ **Complete Integration Achieved:**

1. **Mobile App** → Saves reviews with all required fields
2. **Parish Dashboard** → Reads and moderates reviews for their church
3. **Chancery Dashboard** → Reads and moderates all diocese reviews
4. **Data Compatibility** → Dual field names ensure both systems work
5. **Real-time Updates** → Parish dashboard uses Firestore subscriptions
6. **Security** → Firestore rules enforce access control

**Remaining Task:**
- Apply manual fixes from `REVIEW_REFRESH_FIX.md` to enable auto-refresh in mobile app
