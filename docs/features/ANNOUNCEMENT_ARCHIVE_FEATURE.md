# Announcement Archive Feature Implementation

## Summary

Successfully implemented an archive feature for past announcements in the mobile app. Public users can now view archived (past) announcements by clicking a button, keeping the main announcements view clean and focused on current/upcoming events.

## Changes Made

### File Modified
- **`mobile-app/lib/screens/announcements_screen.dart`**

## Implementation Details

### 1. State Management
- Added `_showArchivedAnnouncements` boolean state variable (default: `false`)
- Past announcements are now hidden by default

### 2. UI Updates

#### Archive Button
When past announcements exist and are hidden, a prominent "View Archived Announcements" button is displayed:
- Shows count of archived events
- Clean card design matching app aesthetics
- Archive icon with forward arrow
- Tappable to reveal archived announcements

**Location:** Between "Ongoing Events" and the bottom spacing

#### Section Visibility
- **Hidden by default:** Past announcements are NOT shown
- **When revealed:** Past announcements appear under "Archived Events" section (renamed from "Past Events")
- Uses `Icons.archive` instead of `Icons.history` for archived section

### 3. Floating Action Button (FAB) Updates

The FAB now intelligently adapts based on user state:

1. **Archive is visible** → Shows "Hide Archive" button (gray color)
   - Clicking hides the archived announcements

2. **Filters are active** → Shows "Clear Filters" button (blue color)
   - Clears all filters AND hides archive

3. **Default state** → No FAB shown
   - Clean interface when no actions needed

### 4. Filter Integration
- When clearing filters, the archive is also automatically hidden
- Ensures consistent UX - filters reset returns to default view

## User Experience

### Before
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Upcoming Events (3)     │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Ongoing Events (2)      │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Past Events (15)        │  ← Always visible, cluttered
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### After
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Upcoming Events (3)     │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Ongoing Events (2)      │
├─────────────────────────┤
│ ┌───────────────────┐   │
│ │  View Archived    │   │  ← Click to reveal
│ │  15 past events   │   │
│ └───────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────┘

         ↓ (User clicks)

┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Upcoming Events (3)     │
