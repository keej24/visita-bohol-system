## Rationale

### Why Remove Statistics Cards?

1. **Redundant Information**
   - Categories already visible in navigation
   - Counts don't drive user action
   - Space better used for content

2. **Simplify User Journey**
   - Focus on discovery (churches, announcements)
   - Remove intermediate steps
   - Direct path to content

3. **Modern Design Trends**
   - Clean, minimal interfaces
   - Content-first approach
   - Less chrome, more content

4. **Mobile Best Practices**
   - Limited screen space
   - Every pixel counts
   - Prioritize actionable content

---

## Content Prioritization

### **Homepage Purpose**
The homepage should help users:
1. ✅ See important announcements
2. ✅ Discover churches
3. ✅ Check their profile status
4. ❌ Count categories (removed)

### **New Focus Areas**

**1. Announcements** (More Visible)
- Diocese-wide events
- Upcoming activities
- Community news

**2. Churches** (Faster Access)
- Immediate search & filter
- Quick browsing
- Direct exploration

**3. Profile** (Clear Status)
- Visit progress visible
- Quick profile access via avatar
- Clean presentation

---

## User Impact

### **Before User Experience**
```
Open app
    ↓
See VISITA header
    ↓
See profile bar
    ↓
See 4 statistics cards (Churches, Heritage, etc.)
    ↓
Scroll past stats
    ↓
See announcements
    ↓
Scroll more
    ↓
Finally reach churches
```

### **After User Experience**
```
Open app
    ↓
See VISITA header
    ↓
See profile bar
    ↓
Immediately see announcements
    ↓
Immediately reach churches section
    ↓
Start exploring
```

**Result:** Faster path to content, less scrolling

---

## Screen Real Estate

### **Space Saved**
- **Height:** ~100-120px saved
- **Viewport:** More content visible without scrolling
- **Focus:** Announcements and churches immediately visible

### **What's More Visible Now**
- Full announcement carousel
- Church section header
- Search and filters
- More church cards in initial view

---

## Design Philosophy

### **Content-First Approach**

**Before:** Feature-rich, information-dense
- Show everything (stats, profile, announcements, churches)
- Risk: Overwhelming, cluttered
- User: Multiple decisions before action

**After:** Content-focused, streamlined
- Show what matters (announcements, churches)
- Benefit: Clear, focused
- User: Immediate action possible

---

## Accessibility Improvements

### ✅ **Reduced Cognitive Load**
- Fewer elements to process
- Clearer visual hierarchy
- Faster comprehension

### ✅ **Better Scrolling**
- Less scrolling needed
- Key content above fold
- Improved navigation

### ✅ **Clearer Purpose**
- Homepage intent obvious
- Explore churches & see events
- No distractions

---

## Alternative Access to Statistics

If users need category counts, they can:

1. **Browse Churches Page**
   - See all churches
   - Filter by type/location
   - Get full details

2. **Use Search/Filter**
   - Diocese filter shows count
   - Category breakdowns available
   - Heritage filter shows heritage sites

3. **Profile Stats** (Future)
   - Personal stats (visited, planned)
   - Achievement metrics
   - Progress tracking
