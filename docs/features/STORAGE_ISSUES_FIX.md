# 🔧 Firebase Storage Issues - FIXED

## Issues Found

### 1. ✅ FIXED: 404 Error - `assets/assets/data/churches.json`
**Problem**: App tried to load local JSON file which doesn't exist (you're using Firebase now)

**Solution**: Disabled `EnhancedChurchService` initialization in `home_screen.dart`
- The app already loads churches from Firestore via `ChurchRepository`
- The old JSON loading service was unnecessary and causing errors

**File Changed**: 
- `mobile-app/lib/screens/home_screen.dart` (line 48-52)

### 2. ⚠️ NEEDS FIX: CORS Error - Firebase Storage Images Blocked

**Problem**: 
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/...' 
from origin 'http://localhost:60167' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Why**: Firebase Storage doesn't allow `localhost` access by default

**Solution**: Configure CORS on your Firebase Storage bucket

## 🚀 Quick Fix for CORS (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Google Cloud Console Shell
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser
2. Select project: **visitaproject-5cd9f**
3. Click the **Terminal icon** (top-right) to open Cloud Shell

### Step 2: Run These Commands
```bash
# Create CORS config
cat > cors.json << 'EOF'
[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600,
    "responseHeader": ["Content-Type"]
  }
]
EOF

# Apply CORS to your bucket
gsutil cors set cors.json gs://visitaproject-5cd9f.firebasestorage.app

# Verify it worked
gsutil cors get gs://visitaproject-5cd9f.firebasestorage.app
```

### Step 3: Refresh Your App
1. Close and restart Flutter web dev server
2. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. Images should now load! ✅
