# Map Button Integration Update

## Date: October 12, 2025

## Change Summary
Updated the Map button in the church detail screen to open the **in-app MapScreen** (using flutter_map/Leaflet) instead of launching external map applications (Google Maps/Apple Maps).

---

## Problem
The Map button was opening external map applications, taking users out of the app. The system already has a fully-functional MapScreen with flutter_map (Leaflet-based) that supports:
- Interactive map with markers
- Church clustering
- Search and filters
- User location tracking
- Direct navigation to church details

---

## Solution
Changed the Map button to navigate to the existing **MapScreen** with the church pre-selected and centered.

---

## Changes Made

### File: `church_detail_screen_modern.dart`

#### 1. Added Import
```dart
import 'map_screen.dart';
```

#### 2. Removed Unused Import
```dart
// REMOVED: import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';
```

#### 3. Updated `_openMap` Method

**Before** (External Maps):
```dart
Future<void> _openMap(BuildContext context, Church church) async {
  if (church.latitude == null || church.longitude == null) {
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      const SnackBar(
        content: Text('Location not available for this church'),
        backgroundColor: Color(0xFFEF4444),
      ),
    );
    return;
  }

  final lat = church.latitude!;
  final lng = church.longitude!;
  final googleMapsUrl = 'https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=$lat,$lng';
  final googleMapsUri = Uri.parse(googleMapsUrl);

  try {
    final canLaunch = await canLaunchUrl(googleMapsUri);
    if (canLaunch) {
      await launchUrl(googleMapsUri, mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);
    } else {
      final appleMapsUrl = 'https://maps.apple.com/?q=$lat,$lng';
      final appleMapsUri = Uri.parse(appleMapsUrl);
      await launchUrl(appleMapsUri, mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);
    }
  } catch (e) {
    if (context.mounted) {
      ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
        const SnackBar(
          content: Text('Could not open maps application'),
          backgroundColor: Color(0xFFEF4444),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
}
```

**After** (In-App Map):
```dart
void _openMap(BuildContext context, Church church) {
  // Check if church has valid coordinates
  if (church.latitude == null || church.longitude == null) {
    ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(
      SnackBar(
        content: const Row(
          children: [
            Icon(Icons.location_off, color: Colors.white),
            SizedBox(width: 12),
            Expanded(child: Text('Location not available for this church')),
          ],
        ),
        backgroundColor: const Color(0xFFEF4444),
        behavior: SnackBarBehavior.floating,
        shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12)),
        margin: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
        duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
      ),
    );
    return;
  }

  // Navigate to MapScreen with the selected church
  Navigator.push(
    context,
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => MapScreen(selectedChurch: church),
    ),
  );
}
```

---

## How It Works

### User Flow:
```
User clicks Map button in church detail screen
  ↓
Check if church has valid coordinates (lat/lng)
  ↓
If no coordinates:
  → Show error SnackBar "Location not available"
  ↓
If coordinates exist:
  → Navigate to MapScreen
  → Pass church as selectedChurch parameter
  ↓
MapScreen opens with:
  ✅ Map centered on church location
  ✅ Church marker highlighted/selected
  ✅ Zoom level 15 (focused view)
  ✅ Church info card displayed at bottom
  ✅ User can interact with map (zoom, pan, view other churches)
```

### MapScreen Features:
When the church is passed as `selectedChurch`:
1. **Auto-centering**: Map automatically centers on church coordinates
2. **Auto-zoom**: Zooms to level 15 for focused view
3. **Marker selection**: Church marker is highlighted
4. **Info card**: Bottom sheet shows church details
5. **Navigation**: User can tap "View Details" to go back to church detail screen
6. **Context**: User can see nearby churches and landmarks

- No need to leave the app
- Seamless navigation flow
- Maintains app context

### ✅ **Better UX**
- Consistent design with app theme

- **Filter panel** (diocese, heritage, visited)
- **User location** tracking
- **Distance indicators**
- **Custom markers** with color coding

### ✅ **Offline Capable**
- flutter_map supports offline tiles (if configured)
- Church data cached locally
- No internet required for basic map viewing

### ✅ **Simpler Code**
- No need for url_launcher package
- No async URL validation
- No external app launching errors
- Reduced code complexity

## MapScreen Integration Details

### Constructor Signature:
```dart
class MapScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  final Church? selectedChurch; // Church to focus on when opening map
  
  const MapScreen({super.key, this.selectedChurch});
}
```

### Selection Behavior:
```dart
void _selectChurch(Church church) {
  setState(() {
    _selectedChurch = church;
  });

  // Center map on the selected church with appropriate zoom
  if (church.latitude != null && church.longitude != null) {
    _mapController.move(
      LatLng(church.latitude!, church.longitude!),
      15.0, // Zoom level for focused view
    );
  }
}
```

### Map Features Available:
- **Marker Clustering**: Groups nearby churches when zoomed out
- **Custom Markers**: Different colors for heritage churches
- **Search**: Text search for church name/location/diocese
- **Filters**:
  - Diocese selection (Tagbilaran, Talibon, All)
  - Heritage only toggle
  - Visited churches only toggle
- **User Location**: Shows user's current position
- **Directions**: Can see distance from user to church
