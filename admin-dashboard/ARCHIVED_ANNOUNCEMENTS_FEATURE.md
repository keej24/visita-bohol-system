# Archived Announcements Feature

## Implementation Summary
Added archived announcements section to the Announcements page with restore functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. AnnouncementManagement Component
- Added `archivedAnnouncements` state
- Added `isLoadingArchived` state  
- Added `showArchived` toggle state
- Created `loadArchivedAnnouncements()` function
- Created `handleUnarchiveAnnouncement()` function
- Added UI section for archived announcements with toggle button
- Lazy loading: archived announcements only fetch when user expands section

### 2. AnnouncementService
- Added `unarchiveAnnouncement(id)` method
  - Sets `isArchived: false`
  - Clears `archivedAt` timestamp
  - Updates `updatedAt` timestamp

### 3. AnnouncementList Component
- Updated archive button logic:
  - Shows "Restore" button (green) for archived announcements
  - Shows "Archive" button for active announcements
  - Both use same `onArchive` prop but behave differently based on state

## User Experience

### Viewing Archived Announcements
1. Navigate to **Announcements** page
2. Scroll to bottom to see **"Archived Announcements"** section
3. Click **"Show Archived (X)"** button
   - X = number of archived announcements
4. View list of archived announcements

### Restoring Archived Announcements
1. Click **green "Restore"** button on any archived announcement
2. Announcement moves back to active list
3. Archived section updates automatically
4. Toast notification confirms restoration

### Features
- ✅ **Auto-archive**: Past events (after `endDate`) automatically archived
- ✅ **Toggle visibility**: Show/hide archived section
- ✅ **Lazy loading**: Archived announcements only loaded when section expanded
- ✅ **Count badge**: Shows number of archived items in toggle button
- ✅ **Restore functionality**: One-click restore to active status
- ✅ **Visual distinction**: Archived items clearly marked
- ✅ **Edit capability**: Can edit archived announcements
- ✅ **Delete capability**: Can permanently delete archived announcements

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [archivedAnnouncements, setArchivedAnnouncements] = useState<Announcement[]>([]);
const [isLoadingArchived, setIsLoadingArchived] = useState(false);
const [showArchived, setShowArchived] = useState(false);
```

### Data Flow
```
User clicks "Show Archived"
  ↓
showArchived state → true
  ↓
useEffect triggers loadArchivedAnnouncements()
  ↓
Firestore query: where('isArchived', '==', true)
  ↓
Display archived list

User clicks "Restore"
  ↓
handleUnarchiveAnnouncement(id)
  ↓
AnnouncementService.unarchiveAnnouncement(id)
  ↓
Firestore update: { isArchived: false, archivedAt: null }
  ↓
Refresh both active and archived lists
  ↓
Toast notification
```

### Firestore Updates

**Archive:**
```typescript
{
  isArchived: true,
  archivedAt: Timestamp.now(),
  updatedAt: Timestamp.now()
}
```

**Unarchive:**
```typescript
{
  isArchived: false,
  archivedAt: null,
  updatedAt: Timestamp.now()
}
```
