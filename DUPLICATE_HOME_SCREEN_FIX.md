# Duplicate Home Screen Fix - October 9, 2025

## Problem Identified:
The app was showing an **old, non-functional version** of the home screen instead of the new **enhanced, functional version** visible in the screenshots.

## Root Cause:
The app has **two different church exploration screens**:

1. **`HomeAnnouncementsTab`** (OLD) - Located in `home_screen.dart`
   - Basic functionality
   - Less organized UI
   - Limited features

2. **`EnhancedChurchExplorationScreen`** (NEW) - Located in `enhanced_church_exploration_screen.dart`
   - Modern, clean UI with "Bohol Churches" header
   - Diocese filters (All Dioceses, Tagbilaran, Talibon, Heritage Sites)  
   - Enhanced search functionality
   - Grid/List view toggle
   - Map integration
   - Better church cards with details button
   - **This is the functional version shown in your screenshots**

The `HomeScreen` widget acts as a **bottom navigation wrapper** with 4 tabs:
- Tab 0: Church Exploration (was using OLD version)
- Tab 1: Map
- Tab 2: Announcements
- Tab 3: Profile

## Solution Applied:

### Changed in `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` (line ~489):

**BEFORE:**
```dart
final List<Widget> _screens = const [
  HomeAnnouncementsTab(),  // OLD version
  MapScreen(),
  AnnouncementsScreen(),
  ProfileScreen(),
];
```

**AFTER:**
```dart
final List<Widget> _screens = const [
  EnhancedChurchExplorationScreen(),  // NEW functional version
  MapScreen(),
  AnnouncementsScreen(),
  ProfileScreen(),
];
```

## Result:
âœ… App now displays the **Enhanced Church Exploration Screen** with:
- Clean "Bohol Churches" header
- Diocese filter chips
- Search functionality
- Proper church cards
- Modern UI matching your screenshots

## Why This Happened:
During development, you created an enhanced version of the church exploration screen but the main navigation was still pointing to the old version. This is common when refactoring UI components.

## Recommendation:
Consider **removing or archiving the old `HomeAnnouncementsTab`** class from `home_screen.dart` since it's no longer needed. This will:
1. Reduce code clutter
2. Prevent future confusion
3. Make maintenance easier

You can either:
- Delete the entire `HomeAnnouncementsTab` class and its state
- Move it to a backup file like `home_screen_old.dart`
- Comment it out with a note about why it was replaced
