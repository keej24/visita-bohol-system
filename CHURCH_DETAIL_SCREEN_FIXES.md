# Church Detail Screen Fixes

**File:** `mobile-app/lib/screens/church_detail_screen.dart`
**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** ✅ All Issues Fixed

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Critical Error: Undefined `_reviewController`**

**Problem:**
- Variable `_reviewController` was used in `initState()` and `dispose()` but never declared
- Caused compilation error preventing the app from running

**Fix:**
```dart
// BEFORE:
class _ChurchDetailScreenState extends State<ChurchDetailScreen>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late TabController _tabController;
  // Missing declaration!

// AFTER:
class _ChurchDetailScreenState extends State<ChurchDetailScreen>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late TabController _tabController;
  late TextEditingController _reviewController;  // ✅ Added
```

**Line:** 29

### 2. ✅ **Unused Imports Removed**

**Problem:**
- Two imports were not being used in the file

**Fix:**
```dart
// REMOVED:
import '../models/announcement.dart';
import '../repositories/announcement_repository.dart';
```

**Impact:** Cleaner code, faster compilation

---

### 3. ✅ **Unused Methods Removed**

**Problem:**
- 5 utility methods were defined but never called anywhere in the code
- Increased file size unnecessarily (70+ lines of dead code)

**Removed Methods:**
1. `_formatDate()` - Date formatting utility (16 lines)
2. `_makePhoneCall()` - Launch phone dialer (7 lines)
3. `_sendEmail()` - Launch email client (7 lines)
4. `_openWebsite()` - Open URL in browser (8 lines)
5. `_openMaps()` - Open Google Maps (8 lines)
6. `_buildCard()` - Card widget builder (48 lines)

**Total Removed:** ~94 lines of unused code

**Lines:** 377-422, 573-574

---

### 4. ✅ **Deprecated API Replaced**

**Problem:**
- Used deprecated `withOpacity()` method (deprecated in Flutter 3.27+)
- Will cause warnings/errors in future Flutter versions

**Fix:**
```dart
// BEFORE (deprecated):
Colors.black.withOpacity(0.6)
Colors.grey.withOpacity(0.2)
Colors.black.withOpacity(0.05)

// AFTER (current API):
Colors.black.withValues(alpha: 0.6)
Colors.grey.withValues(alpha: 0.2)
Colors.black.withValues(alpha: 0.05)
```

**Occurrences Fixed:** 10 instances
**Lines:** 62, 110, 129, 162, 166, 204, 333
